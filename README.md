CheriPom is unfortunately **closed source** at the moment, with no immediate plans to open it.  While I realize that this makes GitHub an awkward place to host its issue tracker, it made the most pragmatic sense for the time being.

My overall rationale was:
- It’s relatively easy to open a new account on GitHub, and many people already have one.
- It doesn’t require any personal maintenance on my part.
- And finally, GitHub is a relatively easy-to-use platform that I’ve already got a lot of experience with.
